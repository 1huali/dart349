      <p>In terms of production, the project taps into analog technologies and digital technologies. </p>
        <p>The technology of a calendar, more specifically the scans of daily tear-away pages, is what carries the content and narrative of the project. A calendar is a system that organized and tracked time around which civilisation organized following nature’s cycles. The lunar timeline were widely followed by ancient civilizations, including the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Chinese. Embracing a calendar aligned with lunar cycles carries symbolically the following of an alternative to the dominant Gregorian calendar, originally established by the Roman Empire and still prevalent today (1). Chinese calendars, like almanacs, contains ancient knowledge about time and nature that also conveys a return to the roots. </p>

      <p>For my project, the default screen is a split screen with a timeline on the left screen-side and scan-images of the a daily calendar page on the left screen side. This template was the most appropriate as a container for a multi sensorial journal. The timeline of the left side is responsive through anchors associated with images scrolling on the right side. In the navigation bar at the top, the current day will be displayed, as well as the counter of days of the genocide and a button to switch to a monthly view of the calendar,  following the traditional option views of digital calendar. My main inspiration is the website of independent fashion designer Kostas Murkudis, a platform designed by Michael Taschinski and Andreas Duschek and programmed by Armin Unruh (https://brutalistwebsites.com/kostasmurkudis.net/). The platform “a-website-is-a-room” (https://a-website-is-a-room.net/) has more responsiveness in the interactivity and translate also the idea of indexing made for intimate place-making.
