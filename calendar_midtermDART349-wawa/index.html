      <p><i>accounts to the moon</i></p>
      <p>This project proposes a web platform dedicated to journaling daily accounts during the Israeli Occupation Force genocide on the Palestinian people since October 7th. Through scans of quick, diligent hand-written documentation of civilian and ground journalistic reports and witnessing of the humanitarian massacre, the project humble accompany the Palestinians in their struggle for liberation. These entries, recorded mechanically each day, culminate in comprehensive reports released every full moon like a prayer; a calling for guidance, mercy and acknowledgement of all levels in the revolution; reiterating the constant interconnectedness between the Sky and the Earth. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of generating genocide archives, this project is interested in following Allan’s methodology centering on what « bodies remember », where « the body is not only a biopolitical subject but a locus of knowledge, both in its individual particularity and as a shared common sense » (Allan, 69). This artistic project sits as a statement in the tension of narratives, centering Palestinian voices as ultimate truth. 
      </p>
      <p>These recollections fill the gaps with personal histories and extends the scientific-dominant literature in the generation of new and complex data about genocide memory.</p>

      <p>For the digital piece of "the calendar", the integration of my banal family lunar calendar, coincidentally carrying the Palestinian colors, is a gesture of internationalist solidarity —a testament to our shared prayers and collective coordination towards the liberation efforts of all People.</p>

      <p><i>"The artists’ role is to make the revolution irresistible"</i></p>
      <p>This project is carried through the voice of an internationalist artist from the Chinese Canadian diaspora. Artists know best about the power of narrativity. Writers, poets, musicians, artists master the weapons of the marginalized.</p>

      <p> If not before, the Palestinian resistance has illuminated the imperative for artistic expression to align with collective liberation goals; the aim to create what Bell Hooks explains as « spaces to find communities », where our voices generate « liberating knowledge from the chokehold of white-supremacist interpretation and thought ».</p>
